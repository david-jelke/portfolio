                    <h2> About </h2>
                    <p> Ignite Mental Health is a startup that provides a virtual think tank and network for students across the country who are passionate about mental health. My three coworkers, the founder, and I worked out of Harvard's Innovation Lab, which is a home to many startups and is steeped in the culture of design thinking. I was brought in to be Ignite's Engagement Chair, although I was often involved in fundraising, recruiting, and video editing.  </p>

                        <h2>Project: Online Community Website for Student Ambassadors</h2>
                        <p>The portal was to be the main feature of being an Ignite Mental Health Ambassador. The 130 student volunteers we had recruited from over 100 colleges in the country needed a friendly forum to meet each other, discuss policy issues, and eventually mobilize.</p>
                            <h3>Portal Inspiration</h3>
                            <p>We took inspiration from other commmunity portals such as GirlUp, a national chain of women's rights clubs across U.S. colleges. </p>

We had a budget of $20, so we of course highlighted cost, but other features such as discussion boards and profile customizability were very important to us as well.</p>

I noticed how intuitive and fun using WordPress was to publish a website, but struggled not having control over granular design elements.

                <h2> Reflection </h2>
                <p>Coming on the heels of taking the design thinking class that would throw a wrench into my life plans, and having started a mental health organization on Dartmouth’s campus, I likened the Ignite job posting on my school’s career development site like a unicorn in the desert. I was thrilled at the opportunity to blend the mental health space with a design thinking ethos. Plus, it didn’t hurt that I would be surrounded by one of the most beautiful and prolific college towns of all time.</p>
                <p>I surprised myself with how fun I had with Pranj in designing the website, but ultimately wanted to do something more hands-on for improving others’ mental health. I took great joy in collaborating with co-interns, loved working in the i-lab, and it opened me up to web design as a meaningful and fun medium of engagement. It would be one that I would revisit in a later internship.</p>
