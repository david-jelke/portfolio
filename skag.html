                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Voyij is an Alaskan travel platform that offers two features: tour-booking and e-commerce. It is based in the 1,000-person cruise destination of Skagway, Alaska. I was brought in to help Voyij build a content strategy and appear higher on the Google Search Results Page for different search terms.</p>

                    <h3>What is SEO?</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption class="small-cap"> SEO is what makes your website one of the first links to appear when you Google something. It is often considered a form of free, albeit competitive, marketing. <br> <br> For example, a company that sells leather yoyos would want a page in their website to be the first page to appear for the search term “leather yoyos” and related search terms. There are many, many factors that go into how much Google likes your website.</figcaption>

                    <h3>Factors of good SEO</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption class="small-cap"> Some websites list hundreds of SEO factors in order of priority. Most experts agree that the most influential factors include how close the title of the webpage matches the search term, how often the search term appears on the page, and the quality of the page's content. However, because Google's algorithm is proprietary, no one knows for certain how Google ranks its search. </figcaption>

                <h3>The report</h3>
                    <p>To help Voyij rank higher in search, I conducted an SEO audit. That basically means I identified what things Voyij is doing that is good for its SEO and offer specific recommendations for what things it could be doing better. The following visuals are slides from a comprehensive audit I completed for Voyij.</p>

                <h3>Voyij's strengths</h3>

                <h3>Where Voyij could improve</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img id="title-tags" src="images/title-tags.png">
                        <figcaption>Voyij's "title tags," or the phrases that appear in blue/purple on search result pages, were too long and therefore cut off by Google. This severley impacted Voyij's search visibility.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>

                        <img id="competing-products" src="images/competing-projects.png">
                        <figcaption>I discovered that Voyij had many duplicate product pages. For example, selecting an orocal gold ring in size 6 would load a different page than one in size 6 &frac12;. The rings also featured different karat selections. This caused the SEO weight of one high-ranking product to be divided amongst 30 or so pages offering the same product in different styles.</figcaption>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>
                <p> One of the most beneficial things you can do to boost your SEO is to publish a continuous stream of content using keywords that are well-suited to the service you offer. I did this by researching keywords with high search volume and low competition. These were the keywords that Voyij could be competitive for. Once I had refined my list, my co-interns and I mapped out a content strategy wherein I would research, write, and publish content once a week. </p>

                    <figcaption>this article was one entry in my overarching content strategy. It utilizes the long-tail keyword “how to fillet a salmon,” which has 2,000 monthly searches on Google and is a low-competition keyword. The keyword appears prominently in the text. In addition, I got to engage in some very hands-on and very Alaskan research to write it (with edits from my boss).</figcaption>

                    <li>Dissapointingly, I was unable to follow through on the analtyics side of the content strategy due the timing of my internships ending and because SEO takes a while to be registered by the Google search engine</li>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Search is a fascinating topic— Google is essentially trying to build models of relevancy and trust for an unspeakably vast sea of content. piqued an interest in data science and analytics. experience also gave me a firsthand look at the massive influence Google has on advertising and brought relevance to a lot of the antitrust stories I had written for Broadband Breakfast. 
            <br>
            <p>Living at a Bed and Breakfast on Skagway’s Main Street charming, but it was hard to get a sense of the cruise town due to the pandemic. Similarly, it was difficult to get a sense of the travel industry because no one was booking tours. The people I did meet in town were eccentric and wonderful, and I made great use of the hiking trails nearby.</p>
            <p>While I enjoyed working on the data and strategy in my work at Voyij, I found myself missing the culture of collaboration at Ignite and the freedom over my work that I enjoyed at Breakfast. Furthermore, I felt like the skills I had learned in each of these internships could be deepened. These musings led to my current pursuit of attending a graduate school in human centered-design.</p>
